  <p style='color: #CDCDCD;'>Welcome to Linear Algebra! This website is a product of my notes that I took during my
    Linear Algebra course. This is mostly just basics, theorums, and the information in here may not be 100% accurate.
    This is not a substitute for taking an actual linear algebra course, of course. But it's here to help anyone who
    wants it.</p>
  <p style='color: #CDCDCD;'>This was designed for Desktop, but is made to accomodate smaller screens as well. The only
    mode available as of right now is Dark.</p>
