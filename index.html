  <p style='color: #CDCDCD;'>Welcome to Linear Algebra! This website is a product of my notes that I took during my
    Linear Algebra course. This is mostly just basics, theorums, and the information in here may not be 100% accurate.
    This is not a substitute for taking an actual linear algebra course, of course. But it's here to help anyone who
    wants it.</p>
  <p style='color: #CDCDCD;'>This was designed for Desktop, but is made to accomodate smaller screens as well. The only
    mode available as of right now is Dark.</p>

  <ul style='color: #CDCDCD;'>
    <li>∃, aka "there exists" -- used in proofs to denote the existence of something. For example, if  y != 0, ∃x such that x/y = 1.</li>
    <li>∀, aka "for all" -- also used in proofs, but this is a stronger quantifier. For example, if x != 0, ∀x (x^2 > 0).</li>
    <li>ℤ -- the set of all integers. Think of it as a group; something is a member of this group if and only if (iff) it's an integer. </li>
    <li>ℝ -- the set of all real numbers.</li>
    <li>𝕀 -- the set of all imaginary numbers.</li>
    <li>ℂ -- the set of all complex numbers (ie, real numbers and imaginary numbers).</li> 
    <li>∈, aka "is a member of" -- used to denote that something is a member of another set. ie, x ∈ ℝ if x is not imaginary.</li>
    <li>∌ -- is not a member of. The opposite of the above. </li>
    <li>ℝⁿ -- nth dimensional euclidean space.</li>
    <li>⊆ -- is a subset of; ie, ℝ ⊆ ℂ because every real number is also a complex number.</li>
    <li>{∅} or ∅ -- an empty set, or a set with nothing in it. Usually used to say a solution does not exist. </li>
    <li>λ -- eigenvalue(s)</li>
    <li>∩ -- intersection of two sets; ie, x ∈ (S ∩ T) iff x ∈ S AND x ∈ T</li>
    <li>⋃ -- union of two sets. x ∈ (S ⋃ T) iff x ∈ S OR x ∈ T</li>
    <li>| -- in a set. Used to denote a parameter to be in a set; ie the set {2k | k ∈ ℤ} is the same set as the set of all even integers.</li>
    <li>[A]ᵢⱼ -- The element in row i and column j of matrix A. </li>
  </ul>
