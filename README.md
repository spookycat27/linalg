# linalg

Why I made this project/what is this project:

Going through my own Liner Algebra notes, I wanted to try to relearn the course because I thought it would be important to know. At the same time, I've only got very limited experience with HTML, CSS, and whatnot. This will help me learn both of those, and if anyone ever wants to go over LinAlg topics, here you are; you're who this project is made for. 
I'll no doubt be sharing this with anyone I know who's taking the class, and you're welcome to do the same. Just note that I don't know if everything in here is 100% accurate. Everything in here is my own understanding and a product of my own notes, so don't take it as word of law. I wouldn't use this as a substitute for any LinAlg class.

What can I use this project for?:

Anything, really. I don't care if sections of my code are copy pasted and plopped into some other project--as long as I'm credited for having written the code that was copied. I chose the GNU General Public License for a reason! 
If there's ever any question with anything related to this project (you believe something is incorrect, want to get permission to do something, etc, etc) feel free to reach out to me on discord (username spookyycat). Just make sure I know what you're talking about.

not to be cheesy, but happy learning
